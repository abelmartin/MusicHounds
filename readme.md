## Preview Build

Since the last time I checked (2/25/12), this project REQUIRES the PREVIEW build of Spotify.

If you have the standard build you'll need to perfrom a clean uninstall & reinstall:

* Make sure that Spotify is no longer running (Spotify Â» Quit Spotify)
* Manually delete these folders:
    * ~/Library/Caches/com.spotify.Client
    * ~/Library/Application Support/Spotify
* Delete the Spotify application in the Applications folder
* (optional) It might be best to restart you computer at this point.
* [Download the preview build](http://developer.spotify.com/en/spotify-apps-api/preview/) of Spotify & reinstall
